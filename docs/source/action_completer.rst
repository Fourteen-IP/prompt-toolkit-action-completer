Action Completer Package
========================

| *Below is autogenerated documentation directly from docstrings in the source.*
| If you are just getting started, I would recommend you first read the
   :ref:`getting-started` documentation. The package documentation included here should
   mostly just be used for reference or a slightly more simple look into the internals
   of the project.
